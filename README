# Carnival CSS

The flexible and adaptable CSS framework.

Nothing to share yet. Just getting started!

### Guiding principles
* Everyting should be configurable with CSS vars
* Can be easily themed to fit any project
* Lightweight
* Modular so SCSS users can import only the modules they need
* Only components
* No layouts, flex, grid, or utils
